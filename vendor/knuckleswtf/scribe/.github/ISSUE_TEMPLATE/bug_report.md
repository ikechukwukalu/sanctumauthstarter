!!IMPORTANT!!

READ BEFORE OPENING AN ISSUE:

- If you don't provide enough information in your issue for me to reproduce (such as version and any custom configuration), I will close it. I can't keep wasting my time investigating issues which no longer exist.
- Check the Troubleshooting Guide! https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/laravel/troubleshooting Some solutions to common problems are detailed there.


Again, HAVE YOU CHECKED THE DOCS? Use the search bar on the docs page before rushing to open an issue. I know it's difficult when you don't know what you're looking for, but do your best.
