!!IMPORTANT!!

READ BEFORE OPENING AN ISSUE:

- If you don't provide enough information in your issue for me to reproduce (such as version and any custom configuration), I will close it. I can't keep wasting my time investigating issues which no longer exist.
- Check the Troubleshooting Guide! https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/laravel/troubleshooting Some solutions to common problems are detailed there.


- [ ] I've read the [documentation](https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/laravel) and I can't find details on how to achieve this.

Okay, but DID YOU REALLY CHECK THE DOCS? Use the search bar on the docs page, and then come back and put an x in the box above only if you don't find answers. I know it's difficult when you don't know what you're looking for, but do your best.
